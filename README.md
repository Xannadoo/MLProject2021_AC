# Machine Learning Project:
## Forensic Identification of Glass Fragments

This project explores the possibility of using elemental composition and refractive index to determine the origin of small glass fragments.

The following machine learning techniques are used to classify the glass fragments:
- Decision tree
- Neural network
- Gaussian Naive Bayes

Both the decision tree and neural network algorithms are written from scatch, with results compared against scikit-learn's implementation.
